The startup AirCity wants to digitize the leasing of 100,000 buildings and apartments in Southeast Asian cities after it reaches success in Vietnam.

_AirCity's founder Le Hoanh Nhat_

The startup which appeared in episode 9 of the "Shark Tank Vietnam" TV show was AirCity, founded by Le Hoang Nhat. It provides all-in building management services using technology.

AirCity manages guest check-in and check-out, contracts, incidents, collection-payment for owners, building maintenance, periodic monitoring and cleaning, reports, receipts and expenses, and issues invoices.

Le Hoang Nhat, the founder of AirCity, said the tech platform can settle three problems that landlords have. First, financial problems. Some tenants give up deposits and cause property losses.

Second, customer relations. Landlords have to be present seven days a week and 24 hours a day to take care of residents, guests and human resources management.

Third, landlords’ difficulties in business expansion because of the two above problems.

Nhat said AirCity helps 12 partners manage 40 buildings with over 500 serviced apartments in HCM City, Hanoi and Can Tho.

The startup built up a database connecting with other technological ecosystems.

AirCity has data about room sales on Tiki, information about fees and confirmation invoices, and automatic debit statement notifications. It also supports  management by using AI cameras for face authentication and check-in without using fingerprints or magnetic cards.

The startup began operation last December with investment capital of $85,000 in exchange for 12 percent of shares for the Antler program of a global investment fund.

The goal of AirCity is to carry out digital transformation of the lease of 100,000 buildings in Southeast Asian cities. It also hopes to become a tech unicorn.

Nhat said AirCity is working with venture funds such as Golden Gate Ventures, Access Ventures, VIC and VIK Partner. The startup hopes the sharks of Shark Tank program will invest $100,000 in exchange for 2 percent of shares.

The founder of Aircity said the startup expects revenue of VND48 million in Q1, VND110 million in Q2, VND230 million in Q3 and VND460 million in Q4. The total revenue of the startup in 2022 would be roughly VND850 million. 

AirCity also helps landlords lease rooms by working with brokers and selling directly on Tiki. At  present, the startup only manages leased houses and street-front houses, not apartments. 

Pham Thanh Hung, vice president of Cen Land, was the only shark who had an interest in AirCity project. The deal was made with Hung’s investment capital of $100,000 in exchange for 10 percent of shares.
